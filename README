What does it do:
-----------------------
Completion for the SQL language includes statements, functions, keywords, operators and database options which it draws from the current SQL syntax file in use.  Vim ships with 9 different SQL syntax files (Oracle, Informix, MySQL, SQL Anywhere, ...).  You can choose different SQL dialects using the command  (see :h sql-dialects):
:SQLSetType sqlanywhere
:SQLSetType <Tab> will cycle through the installed dialects.

It will also dynamically complete tables, procedures, views and column lists with data pulled directly from a database.  It does this in conjunction with the dbext.vim "vimscript #356".  For detailed instructions and a tutorial see :h omni-sql-completion.

Existing instructions can be found within Vim7 using 
:h sql.txt
:h sql-completion

This plugin is new to Vim7.  Improvements to the script will be uploaded here, and supplied to Bram for inclusion into future versions of Vim7.
